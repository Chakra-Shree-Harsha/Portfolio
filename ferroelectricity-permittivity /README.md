# FERROELECTRICITY - PERMITTIVITY

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project investigates the ferroelectric properties of **TGS crystals**, focusing on the temperature dependence of their capacitance. By analyzing the sample’s behavior during heating and cooling cycles, we observed the transition from **ferroelectric** to **paraelectric** material. This process was found to be a **second-order transition**, confirming that the material changes continuously without energy loss.

## 🎯 **Objectives**  
- Measure the temperature dependence of the sample's capacitance according to **Curie-Weiss law**.  
- Determine the **Curie temperature (Tc)** of **TGS crystals** through heating and cooling cycles.  
- Investigate and verify the **second-order phase transition** between ferroelectric and paraelectric states.

## 🛠 **Tools and Software Used**  
- **Optical Instrumentation** for capacitance measurement  
- **Digital Handheld Multimeter** (V-AC range) for voltage readings corresponding to capacitance  
- **Temperature Measuring Box** for precise temperature control  
- **Current Supply** for controlling sample heating  
- **BNC Cables** for reliable connectivity between equipment

## ⚙️ **Procedure**  
1. **Setup Connections**: Connect the BNC cables between the sample box and the capacity measuring box.  
2. **Multimeter Calibration**: Set the digital multimeter to the V-AC range to measure voltage (1 mV = 1 pF).  
3. **Temperature Control**: Connect the heater inside the sample box and use a digital multimeter for temperature readings (0.1 V = 1°C).  
4. **Data Collection**: Begin heating the sample and measure capacitance in 1°C intervals. Gradually slow down heating speed as the Curie temperature is approached.  
5. **Cooling**: After reaching 65°C, reduce the heating current and measure the sample’s capacitance during cooling in intervals of 1°C, using slower cooling rates near the Curie temperature.

## 📄 **Project Report Document**  
The full report includes detailed data analysis and conclusions. It compares the theoretical and experimental Curie temperature values, with the observed Tc for **TGS crystals** at **48.6°C**, compared to the theoretical Tc of **49°C**.
