# **Surveying Instruments: Measurement of Distances, Angles, and Heights**

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
Surveying instruments are essential tools in **mapping, construction, and civil engineering**, used to measure **heights, angles, and distances** on the surface of the ground. This experiment focuses on the **Tachymeter (Tacheometer)**, a specialized theodolite capable of measuring distances rapidly.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Objectives**
The primary aim of this experiment is to understand the **working principles** of surveying instruments and learn how to handle them effectively. The experiment is divided into two parts:

âœ… **Calculating the Floor Area of a Room**  
- Using a **Tachymeter** to measure distances and angles accurately.  
- Determining the **roomâ€™s total floor area** based on collected measurements.  

âœ… **Determining the Radius of Curvature of a Curved Ceiling**  
- Using angular and distance measurements to estimate the **curvature radius**.  
- Applying surveying techniques to analyze architectural structures.  

## **ðŸ›  Tools & Equipment Used**
- **Tachymeter (Tacheometer)** â€“ Measures angles and distances rapidly.  
- **Theodolite** â€“ Ensures high precision in angular measurements.  
- **Measuring Tape** â€“ For reference measurements and validation.
