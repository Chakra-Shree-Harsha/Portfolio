# **Finite Element Analysis of 3-Axis Piezo Stage**

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
This project focuses on evaluating the design of an **XY-stage of Piezo Actuators** through **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**. The primary goal is to assess the **mechanical performance** of the stage under different conditions to ensure precision in movement.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Objectives**
The key tasks in this study include:

âœ… **Stage Stiffness Evaluation**  
- Determining the stiffness of the stage in both **x- and y-directions** at the **output load point**.  
- Stiffness values are provided in **N/mm** to assess mechanical rigidity.  

âœ… **Workspace Determination**  
- Analyzing the displacement of the **output load point** when the **actuators operate within a voltage range of -200V to +200V**.  
- Identifying the effective **workspace** of the stage based on applied voltage constraints.  

âœ… **Mesh Convergence Study & Hand Calculations**  
- Conducting a **mesh convergence analysis** to ensure accurate finite element modeling.  
- Comparing **simulation results** with **hand calculations** for X and Y displacement validation.  

## **ðŸ›  Tools & Software Used**
- **Ansys Workbench** â€“ Finite Element Analysis (FEA)  
- **MATLAB** â€“ Hand calculations and data validation  
- **AutoCAD** â€“ Design visualization and modeling
