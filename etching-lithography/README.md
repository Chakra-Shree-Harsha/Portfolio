# **Etching Lithography on Glass Wafer**

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
This project explores the **etching lithography** process applied to a **glass wafer** for **pattern transfer** in microfabrication. The experiment utilizes **optical lithography** to imprint a pattern onto the glass surface, simulating a step in the **Integrated Circuit (IC) fabrication process**. The process includes the **application of photoresist**, exposure to **UV light**, and the **subsequent etching** of patterns onto the wafer.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Objectives**
The key tasks in this study include:

âœ… **Photoresist Application and Spin Coating**  
- Coating the glass wafer with **photoresist** using the **spin coating machine** for uniform application.  

âœ… **Pattern Transfer**  
- Exposing the wafer to **UV light** through a **photomask** to transfer the desired pattern to the wafer surface.  

âœ… **Examine and Analyze Results**  
- Observing the **uneven development** of the wafer's surface and investigating possible reasons for imperfections.  
- Analyzing the potential **causes of uneven printing**, including issues with **spin coating**, **temperature control**, and **UV exposure time**.

## **ðŸ›  Tools & Equipment Used**
- **Spin Coating Machine** â€“ For uniform **photoresist application**  
- **UV Exposure System** â€“ For transferring patterns to the photoresist layer  
- **Photomask** â€“ For the **pattern design** transferred onto the wafer  
- **Thermocouple** â€“ For monitoring and controlling **temperature** during processing  
- **Glass Wafer** â€“ Substrate for patterning

## **ðŸ“Š Conclusion**
- The **etching lithography process** was successfully carried out on a glass wafer.  
- The **uneven development** observed was likely caused by several factors, including **spin coating errors**, **temperature fluctuations**, and **inadequate UV exposure time**.  
- Further refinements to the process are recommended, such as improving **spin coating uniformity**, **UV exposure duration**, and ensuring a more controlled environment to prevent **moisture or light exposure** from interfering with the development process.
