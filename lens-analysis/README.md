# **Lens Analysis Using Pulfrich Refractometer**

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
This project focuses on the **determination of the refractive index of various prisms** using the **Pulfrich Refractometer**. The refractive index plays a crucial role in understanding the optical properties of different materials, and this experiment aims to analyze it using two measurement methods.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Objectives**
The key tasks in this study include:

âœ… **Refractive Index Determination**  
- Measuring the refractive index of various prisms using **two distinct methods**:  
  - **Measurement by Light Deflection**  
  - **Measurement by Total Internal Reflection**  

âœ… **Abbe Number Calculation**  
- Using experimental values to determine the **Abbe Number** for different prism materials.  
- Analyzing how the **dispersion properties** vary among the tested prisms.

## **ðŸ›  Tools & Equipment Used**
- **Pulfrich Refractometer** â€“ For refractive index measurements  
- **Optical Prisms** â€“ Various types for comparative analysis  
- **Light Source** â€“ Used for deflection and internal reflection experiments

## **ðŸ“Š Conclusion**
- Both methods for determining the refractive index were successfully implemented.  
- The **Abbe Number** for each prism was calculated, allowing classification of materials.  
- Based on the observed **Abbe numbers and refractive index ranges**, **prisms 2, 5, and 6** were identified as **Flint glass prisms** due to their optical properties.
