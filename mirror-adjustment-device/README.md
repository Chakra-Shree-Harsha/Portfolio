# **Mirror Adjustment Device (MAD) Design and Development**

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
This project focuses on designing a **Mirror Adjustment Device (MAD)** used for precise mirror positioning in optical systems. The device is designed to ensure a **45Â° tilt** of the mirror with a precision of **6'**, fulfilling the requirements of optical alignment and adjustment. The MAD is meant to be mounted on an instrument frame with a minimalistic yet efficient design using **Autodesk Inventor**.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Objectives**
The main objectives of the project include:

âœ… **Mirror Positioning and Adjustment**  
- Design a mechanism to adjust the **mirror angle** with precision.  
- Achieve a **tilt of 45Â° Â± 10Â°** with a **precision of 6'**.  

âœ… **Device Mounting**  
- Create a design for mounting the MAD to the instrument's frame.  
- Design the connection between the MAD and the frame.

âœ… **Cost-Effective Design**  
- Implement a **tension spring** and **adjustment screw** mechanism for easy adjustment with minimal stress and extended lifespan.  
- Use **stainless steel** for durability.

## **ðŸ›  Tools & Equipment Used**
- **Autodesk Inventor** â€“ For 3D modeling and design of the Mirror Adjustment Device.  
- **Stainless Steel** â€“ For material selection to ensure the durability and longevity of the device.
